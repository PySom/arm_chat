ARM Chat Application

## Questions

1. How long did you spend on the challenge
- I spent roughly 8 hours on the task. I had aleady built this earlier and what I had to do was to make sure the application built and allowed multiple users chat at the same time

2. If I had more time, I would have added the following
- Unit tests for some critical functions
- Used the BLoC architecture
- Quote replying a message

3. How will I track down performance issue
- Good thing with the app is that there is an analytic integration.
    - I will use the output from the analytics for that screen where the bug is detected to identify the problem
    
4. Suggestions to the firebase team.
- I will suggest having a consistent API accross different upgrades such that only their internal API changes
- Implement technology like App insight where you don't have to plug analytics into your app but get diagnostics
